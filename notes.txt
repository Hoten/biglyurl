Host on GitHub pages
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36296012/is-there-a-configuration-in-github-pages-that-allows-you-to-redirect-everything

Require no backend

biglyurl.com/

google.com -> [103, 111, 111, 103, 108, 101, 46, 99, 111, 109]

how to make array as large as possible, and map it to something like

biglyurl.com/banana/foot/live/shy/tomorrow/etc/...... which is maximum, but shorter than the max URL length

maybe:
biglyurl.com/<encoded url>/generated/output/mimicing/trump/speech
get seed from hash of encoded url
if the part after the encoded url does not match what the seed generates on the page, no redirect will happen
might want to version it: biglyurl.com/1/<encoded url>/...

what is max URL length? about 2000
